In [computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science), **separation of concerns** is a design principle for separating a [computer program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_program) into distinct sections. Each section addresses a separate [_concern_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concern_(computer_science)), a set of information that affects the code of a computer program. A concern can be as general as "the details of the hardware for an application", or as specific as "the name of which class to instantiate". A program that embodies SoC well is called a [modular](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modularity_(programming))[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns\#cite_note-laplante-1) program. Modularity, and hence separation of concerns, is achieved by [encapsulating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encapsulation_(computer_science)) information inside a section of code that has a well-defined interface. Encapsulation is a means of [information hiding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_hiding).[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns#cite_note-mitchell-2) Layered designs in information systems are another embodiment of separation of concerns (e.g., presentation layer, business logic layer, data access layer, persistence layer).[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns#cite_note-microsoft-3)
