## Focus

**Focused mode(zoom in)**

Focus in something

**Diffused mode(zoom out)**

View from broader angle, better to use with some new ideas(topics) which are harder to figure out

MindMapping might also be useful to create basic ideas

  

**Procrastination**

Thinking is hard and painful

Building strong neural structures is easier by doing little every day instead of everything at once

  

## **Chunking**

Itâ€™s grouping data by similar topics

### **Types of memory**

**Working memory (prefrontal cortex)**

Max - 4 chunks of information

**Long term memory**

Need to revisit information from working memory several times to put it in long term

Use spaced repetition to do it - space repetition to different days instead of repeating everything in one day
