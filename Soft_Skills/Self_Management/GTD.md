## Clarify

- If the item will take less than 2 minutes, complete it right away.
- If it can be delegated, assign the task to someone else.
- If it's a non-actionable reference item (eg, a file, document, article, contact information etc.) that you'll need to come back to later, file it away in a separate reference project or attach it to the comments of the relevant task or project.
- If the item needs to be done at a specific date and/or time, give the task aÂ [due date](https://get.todoist.help/hc/en-us/articles/205325931?itm_campaign=getting_things_done&itm_medium=referral&itm_source=productivity_methods_guides).
- If the task is no longer needed or actionable, delete it.
- If a task requires more than one step, create a project to house all of the items associated with it and identify the one next action you can take to move the project forward.
