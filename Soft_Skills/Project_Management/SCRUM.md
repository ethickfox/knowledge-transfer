## **Scrum**

To support the transition to Agile, different frameworks have been developed that align with the Agile mindset, values, and principles. Scrum is one example of a framework that can empower your team to put Agile ways of thinking and working into practice.

Scrum is a framework that unites business and development. It focuses on teams delivering products of the highest value while also being productive and efficient.

On a Scrum team, there are generally two sides of a project: **business** and **development**. The business side of the project is typically represented by a **Product Owner (PO)**, who is accountable for maximizing the product's value resulting from the Scrum team’s work. The PO communicates with key stakeholders and is responsible for the product backlog. The development side is represented by the whole development team, with the **Scrum Master** facilitating Scrum practices and helping the development team monitor and improve their workflow.

### **Ceremonies**

  

Implementing the Scrum framework means adhering to short, timeboxed iterations called **Sprints**. Working in Sprints gives teams multiple opportunities to get fast feedback at different levels. During each Sprint, teams participate in multiple events. 

- **Daily Scrums:** brief check-ins that occur each day—enable team members to assess how successfully they are moving toward the Sprint goal. Other events that occur once per Sprint include:
- Backlog grooming Эстимация? - оценка задач на следующий спринт
- **Sprint Planning:** an event when all team members initiate the Sprint by laying out the work to perform
- **Sprint Retrospective:** an event when team members discuss what went well, what could be improved, and commit to improvements in the next Sprint
- **Sprint Review(Demo):** a timeboxed working session when the team and key stakeholders review the outcomes of a Sprint and identify future steps

All Scrum events support the three Scrum pillars:

- **Transparency  
      
    **requires all team members to be included in all activities required for a project. Events like Daily Scrums support this pillar. This pillar requires all members of the team to embrace openness and trust, while working toward a common goal.
- **Inspection  
      
    **ensures that teams prioritize tasks and that the product is of high quality. Events like Sprint Reviews support this pillar. This pillar requires flexibility and collaboration between the team and the customer to ensure the best possible product.
- **Adaptation**.  
    is apparent across all Scrum events. It focuses on one of the main aspects of being Agile, which is to always be flexible to accommodate the project and customers’ needs. Any changes identified in the Inspection pillar should be accommodated during Adaptation, with continued flexibility and collaboration between the team and the customer.

**Backlog**

A list of new features, changes, bug fixes, or other activities that a team may deliver to achieve a specific outcome.

- На основе capacity спринта берется соответствующее количество задач
- Набираются задачи на доступное количество storypoint

## **Понятия**

**StoryPoint** - сложность задачи в числах фибоначчи. Элементы этой последовательности хорошо отражают рост неопределенности, который возникает с ростом сложности оцениваемой задачи

Epic

Velocity - Величина, отражающая количество работы, которое Скрам-команда может выполнить за один Спринт
