May be asked

- Most Interesting task
    - Use STAR answer format

  

The [STAR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Situation,_task,_action,_result) format is a framework to help you organise answers to behavioural questions - especially ones requiring you to discuss previous experiences

- **Situation** - The interviewer wants you to present a recent challenge and situation which you found yourself in
- **Task** - What were you required to achieve? The interviewer will be looking to see what you were trying to achieve from the situation. Some performance development methods use "Target" rather than "Task". Job interview candidates who describe a "Target" they set themselves instead of an externally imposed "Task" emphasize their own intrinsic motivation to perform and to develop their performance
- **Action** - What did you do? The interviewer will be looking for information on what you did, why you did it, and what the alternatives were
- **Results** - What was the outcome of your actions? What did you achieve through your actions and what did you learn? What steps did you take to improve after the experience?
