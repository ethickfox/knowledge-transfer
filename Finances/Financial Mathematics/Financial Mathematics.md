### Interest

**Interest** is payment from a [borrower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debtor) or deposit-taking financial institution to a [lender](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lender) or depositor of an amount above repayment of the [principal sum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_sum) (that is, the amount borrowed), at a particular rate

As a rule, interest can be calculated in the following manner:

There are three ways to determine the number of days (D).

1. Actual: Counting the actual numbers of days that elapse.
2. 30: Each month counts as 30 days (remaining days in a month are subtracted).
3. 30E: Each month counts as 30 days (the 31st is treated as if it was the 30th; remaining days are subtracted).

There are three ways to determine the day basis (B).

1. 360: Assuming that each year has 360 days.
2. 365: Assumption that each year has 365 days.
3. Actual

### The Yield Curve

The yield curve (also known as interest rate structure) displays interest rates of a specific financial instrument for different terms to maturity.

For example the T-bond curve shows the yields of US Treasury bonds (“T-bond”) with various terms to maturity. Due to the number of different instruments there are a lot different yield curves such as interest rate swap (IRS) curve, LIBOR-curve, Bund-curve, mortgage bond-curve, etc.

There are three different types of yield curves:

- **Steep yield curve**: (normal or positive) short-term interest rates are lower than long-term interest rates.
- **Flat yield curve**: interest rates for different terms are the same.
- **Inverse yield curve**: short-term interest rates are higher than long-term interest rates.
