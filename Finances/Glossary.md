1. A ***derivative*** is a financial contract whose value is based on, or "derived" from, the performance of an underlying asset, index, or rate. The underlying asset can be anything from a stock, bond, commodity, interest rate, currency, or even an index like the S&P 500. 
	1. Types of Derivatives
		1. Futures Contracts
		2. Options Contracts
		3. Forwards Contracts
		4. Swaps
		
2. An ***interest rate*** is the cost of borrowing money or the reward for lending money, expressed as a percentage of the principal (the original amount of money). It represents the compensation lenders receive for forgoing other uses of their funds, and the cost that borrowers incur for accessing money they don’t own.

3. ***Short selling*** - is a trading strategy that allows investors to profit from a decline in the price of an asset, typically a stock. Instead of buying low and selling high, short sellers sell high first and buy low later, making a profit if the price of the asset falls.
	1. Borrow the Stock
	2. Sell the Borrowed Shares - Once borrowed, the short seller immediately sells the shares at the current market price. For example, if the price is $50 per share and 100 shares are sold, the short seller receives $5,000 in proceeds.
	3. Wait for the Price to Drop - The short seller’s objective is for the stock price to decline. If the price drops, the short seller can buy back the shares at a lower price.
	4. Buy Back (Cover) the Shares
	5. Return the Borrowed Shares
 
4. ***Margin account*** -  allows the broker to lend shares to the investor. 
5. ***Hedging*** is a risk management strategy used by investors, companies, and institutions to reduce or eliminate the risk of adverse price movements in an asset. By entering into a financial position or using a derivative that offsets the potential losses from another investment, hedging allows one to protect against negative market scenarios. The goal of hedging is not necessarily to maximize profits, but to minimize losses and provide a level of security against unpredictable events or market fluctuations. Hedging Strategies
	1. Options Hedging - put options to protect against a decline in the value of an asset, or call options to protect against an increase in a liability.
	2. Futures Hedging - Entering into a futures contract to buy or sell an asset at a fixed price in the future.
	3. Forward Contracts - Similar to futures but customized and traded over-the-counter (OTC). 
	4. Swaps - A company might use interest rate swaps to exchange a floating rate for a fixed rate 
	5. Short Selling - Selling borrowed shares in anticipation of a price decline is a form of hedging against a long position.
