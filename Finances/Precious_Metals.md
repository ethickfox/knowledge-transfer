Like in the financial markets there have been developed quite a few derivative instruments from the spot market. The metal traded the most is gold, followed by silver, platinum and palladium.
For a lot of investors precious metals – especially gold - are “safe haven” investments in times of crisis.
Like in other markets a substantial part of the traded volume is done by traders who try to earn from speculation on rate changes or arbitrage.
## Conventions
In the international market precious metals are quoted in US Dollar (USD). Prices are usually quoted per ounce (troy ounce, oz). One ounce is 31.1034807 grams.

## London Gold Fixing
The „London Bullion Market Association“ (LBMA) conducts a gold fixing twice a day. 
The fixing has two functions:
1. **Conducting trades at fixing rate:** customers can place orders with the fixing banks. Their representatives then calculate a rate in a transparent process where buy and sell orders compensate each other.
	1. Customers place their orders with the fixing banks. 
	2. The banks forward the balance to their representatives at the fixing.
	3. The metal price is then currently adjusted, depending on whether there are more buyers or sellers at the current price. This is done until bid and offer compensate each other at a certain price.
	4. During the fixing procedure customers can change their orders. This is shown by the particular representative by lifting a small flag. The final price can only be fixed when there is no flag lifted anymore.
	5. The fixing is a transparent process which allows customers to follow price changes as well as bid and offer changes. With this information they are in a position to adjust their orders.
2. **Benchmark:** The London Gold Fixing is calculation basis for the cash settlement of derivative instruments (e.g. options, swaps).

## Settlement of Precious Metals
The settlement of a metal contract can either be delivered physically or as an account credit.
1. **Physical delivery** - The seller delivers the traded metal amount at the arranged place. 
2. **Account credit (book entry)** - If the buyer does not need the metal physically (e.g. for processing) but only wants to invest in gold to participate from future appreciation values, he might not be interested in a physical delivery. Alternatively the purchase can be credited to a metal account. Legally the metal does not change the owner. Instead he obtains the right to receive the metal physically. The buyer saves mainly storage, insurance and transport costs.
## Spot market
Spot deals are transactions with immediate settlement, i.e. usually 2 workdays after trade date.
## Forward market
Forward deals are transactions with settlement later than spot date, i.e. later than 2 workdays after trade date.
### Influences
Instead of buying the metal value forward a market participant could also buy the metal value spot and keep it until the forward date. 

1. Contango - the sum of the refinancing, storage and insurance costs. If it exceeded this value in the market, following arbitrage would be possible:
	1. sell forward and simultaneously
	2. buy spot, refinancing of the amount and storage of the metal until the forward date
2. Backwardation - depot that forward price has from spot price. There are mainly two reasons for this deport for the longer forwards:
	1. Commodities are produced day-to-day and commodity producers can sell them value forward. With the effort to hedge future productions against price decreases long-term, producers can squeeze the long forward prices to a lower level.
	2. On the other hand you have companies who need commodities for their productions. A demand surplus can lead to higher premiums for being deliverable for short periods.
In contrary to the contango the backwardation is not limited and with an extreme demand surplus it can lead to spot prices well higher than forward prices.
