A **spot trade**, also known as a **spot transaction**, refers to the purchase or sale of a foreign currency, financial instrument, or commodity for instant delivery on a specified spot date. Settlement typically **occurs "on the spot,"** or within a very short time frame, usually two business days (T+2) for many assets, although for some markets like forex, it may happen the next business day (T+1). Unlike futures or forward contracts, spot contracts **do not involve any future obligation**. The transaction is **completed immediately,** and there are no commitments beyond the settlement.

A **spot FX transaction** is the purchase or sale of one currency for another, with delivery usually two days after the dealing date.

The exchange rate at which the spot transaction is done is called the **spot rate**.

**Spot rates are quoted** as one unit of the base currency (= base currency) against a number of units of the quote currency (also variable currency or counter currency).

> 1 unit of base currency = x units of quote currency

If the spot rate quoted for EUR/USD is 1.0850, this means that one Euro is worth 1.0850 USD.

Spot rates are usually **quoted in two rates**, the **bid rate**(rate at which the market maker is ready to **buy** the base currency from the market user) and the **offer rate** (the price at which the market maker will **sell** the base currency to the market user. ).

> EUR/USD 1.0850/1.0860

**Market-maker** (quoting bank) **buys at bid rate** and **sells at offer rate**.

**Market-user** (bank asking for a quote) **buys at offer rate** and **sells at bid rate.**

> [!important]  
> ExampleYou want to buy USD 10 m against EUR.Four different banks quote you the following prices:Bank A: 1.0830 - 40Bank B: 1.0850 - 60Bank C: 1.0800 - 10Bank D: 1.0790 - 00Where do you buy your USD?I. The base currency is the EUR. You want to buy USD, meaning you sell EUR.II. You ask for the rate. You act as market user and sell EUR at the highest bid rate at 1.0850 to Bank B.Thus you buy USD 10 m at the rate of 1.0850 and pay EUR 9,216,589.86. (10,000,000/1.0850).  

The **market user** is the counterpart asking for prices.

If a dealer receives a call from another bank, in order to make a quote, he acts as the **market maker.**

**Value date of spot transactions** - two days after the dealing date, only business days

**Swift Codes** - Each currency can be identified by a three-letter code.

Banks can not only trade directly with each other but also via **broker**. A broker acts as an agent for the two counterparties and receives a brokerage for his service.

**Spread**

The spread is the difference between the bid and offer rates.

**Positions**

- **Long position -** dealer has **bought more** of the currency **than** he has **sold**. Dealer **expects** the currency **to rise.**
- **Short position**  - dealer has **sold** **more** of the currency **than** he has **bought**. Dealer **expects** the currency **to fall.**
- **Square position** dealer has **sold** **same amount** of the currency as he **bought**. **No** risk if the **rates** **change**.

**Direct / indirect quote**

In the international markets most currencies are quoted against the USD. In this case the USD is usually the base currency (e.g. USD/CHF, USD/NOK).

- **Direct quote** - home currency is the quote currency and the foreign currency is the base currency
    - CZK in Zurich: CZK/CHF 4.8075 (i.e. 100 CZK cost 4.8075 CHF)
    - CHF in Prague: CHF/CZK 20.800 (i.e. 1 CHF costs 20.800 CZK)
- **Indirect quote** home currency is the base currency and the foreign currency is the quote currency.
    - CHF in Prague: CZK/CHF 4.8075
    - CZK in Zurich: CHF/CZK 20.800

The last two digits of the spot rate are the so-called **pips**.The rest of the spot quotation is called **big figure**.

> In day-to-day business, spot dealers assume that, every counterpart knows the big figure of the given quotation. Hence, spot rates are often quoted only with their pips.

**Cross Rates**

A cross rate is the **quote** for a currency pair **which** **does not include the USD**.

USD/CHF and USD/NOK rates are quoted in the market. Using the quote of CHF and NOK against the USD, the NOK/CHF cross rate can be calculated.

- **Bid Rate** to compute the NOK/CHF bid rate
    - We **sell** **NOK** 1 and **buy USD** 0.1580
    - We **sell USD** 0.1580 and **buy CHF** 0.23668
    - **Result:** NOK/CHF is 0.2367
- **Offer rate**  to compute the NOK/CHF offer rate
    - We **buy NOK** 1 and **sell USD** 0.15805
    - We **buy USD** 0.15805 and **sell CHF** 0.23683
    - **Result:** NOK/CHF offer rate is 0.2368.
