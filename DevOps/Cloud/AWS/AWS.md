One of Amazon’s first AWS services, Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) provides cloud-based computing power for users. AWS delivers as much compute resources as you need, and your enterprise can scale up or down on compute power whenever it wants. Amazon EC2 instances are designed to be flexible as you can configure the memory, CPU, instance storage, and boot partition size to meet your enterprise’s demands.

  

Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) is another one of the original AWS services. Amazon S3 is a scalable data storage service that allows you to keep your data stored in the cloud. S3 is built on a system of Storage Classes, which offers various levels of access levels for your data.

Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) provisions out an isolated segment of the AWS cloud and creates a virtual network for AWS users. This virtual network configuration is completely customizable, including IP address range, subnet distribution, routing tables, and network gateways. Amazon VPC’s virtual networks support both IPv4 and IPv6 protocols.

In order to maintain security in your AWS operations, you need a service that can monitor the applications and resources you use in the cloud. Amazon CloudWatch collects data about your AWS deployment from logs, metrics, and events. This allows your enterprise to keep an eye on the AWS services, applications, and resources you’re using so you know how your deployment is performing as a whole.

**Gain timely insights by leveraging Amazon Kinesis to collect, process, and analyze data in real-time, helping you react quickly. Key features inside AWS Kinesis are cost-efficient processing of streaming data at scale, and the option to choose tools best fit for your application.**

**Ingest real-time data, including video, audio, application records, website activity, and IoT telemetry data for machine learning and other apps. With Kineses, users can track, analyze, and process data in real-time, enabling instant response capabilities.**

With AWS, just like any public cloud environment, resources can be scaled up and down to suit your requirements. AWS Auto Scalling continuously monitors your AWS applications and services to help you determine the optimal amount of resources your organization needs. With AWS Auto Scaling, your company can set target utilization levels to help maintain and manage resource usage.

When you use multiple AWS services, you need to manage your expenditures. Amazon offers their own tool for keeping track of your AWS costs and resource usage. AWS Cost Explorer generates reports on your current AWS expenses and can predict future costs and resource usage based on historical and recent trends.

Amazon S3 Glacier is an off-shoot of Amazon S3 that is designed specifically for cold data storage and archiving. Many enterprises need to hold on to specific data for either regulatory or business purposes, even if they don’t need to access it every day. Glacier offers the lowest storage costs of all AWS storage and you can expedite archived data retrieval to receive this data within minutes.

**Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) makes database configuration, management, and scaling easy in the cloud. Automate tedious tasks such as hardware provisioning, database arrangement, patching, and backups – cost-effectively and proportionate to your needs.**

**RDS is available on various database instances which are optimized for performance and memory, providing six familiar database engines including Amazon Aurora, PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB, Oracle. database, and SQL server. By leveraging the AWS Database Migration Service, you can easily migrate or reproduce your existing databases to Amazon RDS. Visit Amazon’s RDS page.**

  

**Lambda permits you to run code without owning or managing servers. Users only pay for the compute time consumed.**

**Operate code for nearly any application or backend utility without administration. Users just upload the code, and Lambda does the rest, which provides precise software scaling and extensive availability.**

  

**AWS Cognito administers a control access dashboard for on-boarding users through sign-up, and sign-in features to their web and mobile apps. AWS Cognito scales to millions of users and offers sign-in support with social identity providers including Facebook, Google, and Amazon, along with enterprise identity providers via SAML 2.0.**

  

**Amazon SNS is a fully managed messaging solution that provides low-cost infrastructure for bulk message delivery, primarily to mobile users. Users can chat directly with customers through system-to-system or app-to-person communication between decoupled microservice apps.**

  

**Amazon Lightsail is an easy on-ramp for users who are getting started with AWS and just need virtual private servers. Lightsail has the tools required for a speedy product launch at a low and predictable price.**

**The resources included in Lightsail are virtual machines, SSD-based storage, data transfer, DNS management, and a static IP. After the provision of an instance, you can easily manage them within the Lightsail console, Lightsail API, or Lightsail command line interface.**

  

  

**Inspector provides automated security assessment to enhance security and compliance of apps deployed on AWS. AWS Inspector automates security audits to reveal vulnerabilities, exposures, and deviations.**

**After each assessment, Inspector displays a comprehensive list of security findings prioritized by the level of threat presented to your software - available on the user console or API.**

  

**AWS Identity and Access Management provides secure access and management of resources in a secure and compliant manner. By leveraging IAM, you can create and manage users and groups by allowing and denying their permissions for individual resources.**

**There are no additional costs, people only get charged for the use of other services by their users.**

  

**DynamoDB is a document database with key-value structuring that delivers single-digit millisecond performance at scale. Dynamo has built-in security with a fully managed, multimaster, multiregion, durable database, backup and restore, and in-memory archiving for web-scale applications.**

**DynamoSB can manage upward of 10 trillion requests daily and can support thresholds of more than 20 million requests per second.**

  

**AWS SQS is a fully managed message queuing facility enabling you to decouple and scale microservices, distributed systems, and serverless apps. SQS purges the intricacies and overhead associated with managing and operating message-oriented middleware and permits developers to focus on diverse workloads.**

**With SQS, users can send, store, and receive messages between multiple software parts en masse, without losing message data or requiring the availability of other systems. SQS offers two classes of message queues, including standard queues, which provide maximum throughput and FIFO queues to guarantee that messages are processed only once, in the exact order the sequences occurred**

  

  

**ElastiCache is an AWS service that effortlessly sets up, runs, and scales popular open-source, in-memory data storages in the cloud. Operate data-intensive apps or enhance the performance of existing databases by evaluating data from high throughput and low latency in-memory data stores.**

**AWS ElastiCache is a popular option for real-time use cases including caching, session stores, gaming, geospatial services, live analytics, and queuing. For high-maintenance applications that require sub-millisecond response times, ElastiCache offers fully managed Redis and Memcached applications.**

  

**Amazon Athena facilitates straightforward analysis of data stored in Amazon S3 by utilizing the standard Structured Query Language (SQL), Since Athena is serverless, there is no infrastructure to maintain, and you only pay for the queries you execute. It’s simple to get started with Athena. Simply specify the Amazon S3 bucket containing your data, specify the structure, and begin regular SQL queries.**

  

**CodeCatalyst comes with a slew of continuous integration/continuous development (CI/CD) tools and can leverage other AWS services and be connected to other AWS projects on an account. As a collaborative tool, it is easy to introduce new members to the project and to log all activity or all tests from a single dashboard.**

  

[**AWS WAF**](https://allcode.com/aws-web-application-firewall/) **(Web Application Firewall) is an online application firewall that helps protect your web applications or APIs against typical web exploits and bots that can cause availability issues, security compromises, or resource consumption issues.**

  

[**AWS Amplify**](https://allcode.com/aws-amplify/) **is a suite of purpose-built tools and capabilities meant to make building full-stack applications on AWS simpler for front-end web and mobile developers.
