1. Install and set up Kubernetes on your local machine or cloud platform. If you use GCP, you **[can](https://iamgique.medium.com/deploy-springboot-to-gke-from-scratch-in-7-minutes-c6d3534f69be)** create Kubernetes cluster using Google Kubernetes Engine.
2. Create a new Spring Boot project using any IDE of your choice or use the Spring Initializr website ([**https://start.spring.io/**](https://start.spring.io/)) to generate a project template.
3. Add the necessary dependencies in your `**pom.xml**` or `**build.gradle**` file. These dependencies should include the Spring Boot Starter Web and the Kubernetes Java client libraries.
4. Create a Dockerfile in the root directory of your project that specifies how to build your application image. Here is an example Dockerfile for a Spring Boot application:
    
    ```Docker
    FROM openjdk:11-jre-slim
    WORKDIR /app
    COPY target/*.jar app.jar
    ENTRYPOINT ["java", "-jar", "app.jar"]
    ```
    
    This Dockerfile uses the official OpenJDK 11 JRE image as the base image, sets the working directory to `**/app**`, copies the JAR file generated by the Maven build into the container, and specifies the entry point command to run the JAR file.
    
5. Build a Docker image of your application using the Dockerfile created in step 4. Run the following command in your project directory:
    
    ```Shell
    docker build -t <image-name>:<tag> .
    ```
    
    This command builds a Docker image tagged with a name and a version specified in `**<image-name>**` and `**<tag>**`, respectively.
    
6. Push the Docker image to a container registry of your choice. For example, to push the image to Docker Hub, run the following command:
    
    ```Shell
    docker push <image-name>:<tag>
    ```
    
7. Create a Kubernetes deployment YAML file that specifies how to deploy your application as a containerized workload. Here is an example deployment YAML file:
    
    ```YAML
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    metadata:
      name: <deployment-name>
    spec:
      replicas: 1
      selector:
        matchLabels:
          app: <app-name>
      template:
        metadata:
          labels:
            app: <app-name>
        spec:
          containers:
          - name: <container-name>
            image: <image-name>:<tag>
            ports:
            - containerPort: 8080
    ```
    
    This YAML file specifies a deployment with one replica, a container image specified by `**<image-name>**` and `**<tag>**`, and a container port set to 8080.
    
8. Create a Kubernetes service YAML file that specifies how to expose your application as a network service. Here is an example service YAML file:
    
    ```YAML
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Service
    metadata:
      name: <service-name>
    spec:
      selector:
        app: <app-name>
      ports:
      - protocol: TCP
        port: 80
        targetPort: 8080
    ```
    
    This YAML file specifies a network service with a name of `**<service-name>**`, which routes traffic to the deployment selector with the `**app**` label set to `**<app-name>**`. The port configuration maps the container port of 8080 to the service port of 80.
    
9. Apply the deployment and service YAML files to your Kubernetes cluster using the `**kubectl apply**` command. Run the following commands:
    
    ```YAML
    kubectl apply -f <deployment-file>.yaml
    kubectl apply -f <service-file>.yaml
    ```
    
    These commands create the Kubernetes deployment and service objects in the cluster.
    
10. Verify that your application is running by accessing the service URL in a web browser or by using the `**curl**` command:
    
    ```Shell
    curl http://<
    ```
