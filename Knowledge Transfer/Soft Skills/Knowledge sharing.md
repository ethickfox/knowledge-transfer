Even though all projects are different, knowledge sharing has universal goals.

- Keep projects up and running.
- Communicate project standards and best practices.
- Optimize the team’s efforts and keeps everyone’s focus on the right priorities.
- Make necessary information readily available.
- Decrease the amount of time your team members spend on regular activities, like onboarding.

**Healthy vs. Unhealthy Knowledge Sharing**

- **Healthy knowledge sharing** ensures a project runs smoothly and minimizes risks to delivery or implementation. The information that your team should share covers general project areas (such as code, technology, or client information) and team member expertise and skills that are valuable to everyone. Your team may choose to share your knowledge through team meetings and in a knowledge base. You can also use chats, videos, e-learning courses, and other sources to transfer project knowledge. No matter which approach or tool you choose, knowledge sharing must be mutually beneficial. When you exchange your knowledge with others, you contribute to your team's progress—and you know you can count on them when you need information.
- **Unhealthy knowledge sharing** can put a project at risk because it has the potential to delay or block productivity and successful delivery. Knowledge sharing can become unhealthy for a variety of reasons. If you have specific knowledge but fail to share it—either fully or partially—your colleagues may perceive your behavior as disorganized or selfish, which can provoke distrust and impact team unity. Additionally, if material is out of date or has errors it becomes a liability.

**Impacts of Unhealthy Knowledge Sharing**

- **Unclear Project Priorities  
      
    **When your team neglects proper knowledge sharing, project priorities might seem unclear, or people may lose focus on them. Uncertainty about priorities can lead to double work because team members might complete unnecessary tasks or complete tasks in the wrong way.
- **Unclear Project Standards  
      
    **When project standards are unclear, teams often disregard them, along with project processes and conventions. As a result, miscommunication and misunderstandings can arise, and the quality of work can be diminished.
- **Waste of Project Resources  
      
    **When your team does not have a properly managed knowledge base, individual productivity decreases significantly. You spend too much time investigating the details required to perform your tasks, searching through a messy team knowledge base in vain, or asking teammates for guidance. You may spend hours waiting for other people to reply to your questions—and still not get the information you need. This misuse of resources—human, time, and money—is wasteful from a project management perspective, too.
- **Bus Factor  
      
    **The bus factor is the number of members on your team whose absence can block project implementation. You’ve likely encountered a situation like the bus metaphor: a person is involved in some kind of accident, preventing them from completing any work. The reasons for being away from work vary: it could be a vacation, sick leave, maternity leave, or an emergency. Or the person might decide to leave the project or company.  
    When the bus factor on your project is equal to one, there is a single keeper of unique knowledge who becomes a blocker. If that person is absent for any reason, the project is immediately at risk. Other team members cannot complete their tasks because they don’t have the necessary information that the knowledge keeper usually provides. As a result, the team’s productivity decreases overall.  
    
- **Missing Information  
      
    **If your team members communicate a significant amount of project information verbally, it can be easily lost or misunderstood. Relying on verbal knowledge sharing can lead to gaps in task implementation and differences in the project vision.
- **Ineffective Onboarding  
      
    **As a project grows, so should the team. The onboarding process must equip new team members with the knowledge that your team has already obtained. An ineffective onboarding process is typically lengthy and challenging. Without clear guidance, newcomers often feel lost and cannot perform their tasks. As a result, the value of their contributions is diminished, and they will likely feel demotivated and stressed.

  

**Benefits of Healthy Knowledge Sharing**

- **A Stable Team  
      
    **With a bus factor higher than one, a team member can leave the project without affecting timelines, and the team is more stable. Everyone focuses on the activities that are important now, and the priorities are clear. Your team can stay on the right development track.
- **Alignment Through Documented Standards  
      
    **Documented project practices, processes, and guidelines for all competencies ensure that your team’s standards are in place and can be followed. As a result, your team members will remain aligned and produce consistent work and results.
- **Available Comprehensive Information  
      
    **Team members need a minimal amount of time to find all necessary information because they can easily access it. Everyone takes an active role in updating the knowledge base regularly.
- **Smooth Onboarding  
      
    **The onboarding process is smooth and requires minimal effort from the project team.

**Improving Four Project Areas with Knowledge Sharing**

Knowledge sharing happens throughout the life of a project, and there are four key areas where it has a significant impact:

- **Software Development Life Cycle Process  
      
    **Use the following steps to make your development process clear and structured.
    - **Review artifacts with rotating peers:** Periodically change reviewers and assign them to provide feedback on different aspects of the solution.
    - **Diversify task assignments:** Avoid the situation when the same kind of tasks or solution areas are assigned to the same person. In addition, keep more than one person familiar with a solution area.
    - **Keep breadcrumbs of your work:** Save useful information while working on a task. If there are some important updates, make changes to the knowledge base on the fly.
    - **Plan time for documentation:** When your team estimates the duration of project tasks, make sure you cover documentation-related activities to support regular updates.
- **Knowledge base  
      
    **To keep all project documents in one location that every team member can access, your team should have a common knowledge base: a Wiki, Confluence space, or other space that your team or organization chooses. It is everyone’s responsibility to keep the space up to date.  
    Make sure your team’s knowledge base contains:  
    - The project goal and description
    - The project team structure and roles
    - Links to project resources
    - Links to environments
    - Project standards, rules, and conventions (for all competencies: Managers, Developers, Quality Assurance Engineers (QA), Business Analysts (BA), DevOps Engineers, etc.)
    - The development process description (branching, release process, task life cycle, etc.)
- **Onboarding procedures**  
    A successful onboarding procedure includes comprehensive guidelines for newcomers.   
    **A newcomer’s guidebook** is the primary reference source for anyone who joins your team. It should contain links to project resources and the knowledge base, along with the work environment installation guide.  
    This is the responsibility of the entire development team to create and maintain the guidebook to help newcomers onboard as quickly and effortlessly as possible.  
    Assigning a mentor to every newcomer also helps them adapt successfully. Effective mentors are open and available for any questions, and they take responsibility for helping the new team member adapt.  
    
- **Team communication**  
    Ensure successful knowledge sharing by improving your project-related communication.  
    - **Conduct knowledge sharing sessions/sync-ups:** Sharing sessions and syncs provide opportunities for teams to communicate task progress, discuss project plans, and raise common questions and issues. These meetings should be regular events to help close knowledge gaps as soon as they appear. For example, your team might conduct weekly or bi-weekly project syncs to maintain ongoing communication.
    - **Keep team chats focused and diverse:** Dedicate each chat to one specific topic. Make sure you add all the relevant people to the chat to provide a variety of perspectives.
    - **Post important updates in news channels:** When there is important information to share with your team, post updates in the dedicated news channels. Remember to mention critical people in your message to ensure they will see it and highlight key messages so they don’t get lost among more recent posts.
    - **Participate in project townhalls:** Project townhalls enable managers and architects to share key project updates and remind their team members about deadlines and plans. Your participation in these events will give you a chance to keep up with the global project vision.
    - **Send meeting follow-ups:** If you are a meeting organizer, remember to share meeting results with participants and other interested people. These follow-up notes are valuable sources of information when you need to quickly recap progress or team agreements.
