**Deployment Models**

- **Private Cloud  
      
    **Private cloud service runs on dedicated hardware. It often serves as a bridge between the public cloud and legacy on-premises systems. A private cloud's capacity is static, based on how much storage has been paid for; it can be run internally or by an independent contractor.
    
    This is a step toward a public cloud for many organizations, allowing solutions around security and data sovereignty to be resolved before moving to a public cloud.
    
- **Public Cloud**
    
    Public clouds are run by a specialist provider in their data centers and are accessible via the internet or private connections. They do not require an independent data center space for system maintenance or the purchase of hardware or software.
    
    Moving to a public cloud is an economical solution for organizations seeking to avoid capital expenses. However, if you are considering migration, you will want to thoroughly assess your cloud provider's security model; the public cloud is only a good deal if it keeps your data secure.
    
- **Hybrid Cloud  
      
    **Hybrid clouds are computing environments that use a mixture of on-premises data storage, private cloud, and third-party public cloud services. These environments work together to perform a single task. A combination of these environments allows businesses to fulfill their unique needs by tailoring which services they useâ€”for example, your organization may not be ready to move to the cloud entirely or may have some highly sensitive data that you'd rather store in a private cloud.
- **Multi-cloud**
    
    Multi-cloud is a strategy in which multiple computing and storage services are used in a single heterogeneous architecture. It aims to distribute cloud assets, software, and applications across several cloud-hosting environments, eliminating the need to rely on a single provider.
    
    This approach differs from a hybrid cloud in that the cloud services can function either independently or together, as opposed to multiple types of infrastructure functioning collectively (e.g., a data center, private cloud, and a public cloud).
