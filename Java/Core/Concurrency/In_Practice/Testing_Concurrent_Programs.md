# Testing Concurrent Programs 
Most tests of concurrent classes fall into one or both of the classic categories of  safety and liveness.

we defined safety as “nothing bad ever happens”  and liveness as “something good eventually happens”. 
Related to liveness tests are performance tests. Performance can be measured  in a number of ways, including:  Throughput: the rate at which a set of concurrent tasks is completed;  Responsiveness: the delay between a request for and completion of some action  (also called latency); or  Scalability: the improvement in throughput (or lack thereof) as more resources  (usually CPUs) are made available.
